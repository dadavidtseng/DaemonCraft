  "description": "Requesting approval for project-wide steering documents (P-3 prerequisite for Assignment 7):\n\n**Documents Created:**\n\n1. **product.md** (~350 lines)\n   - Product vision and purpose: Transform SimpleMiner into playable Minecraft-like game with AI integration\n   - 5 Product Principles: Minecraft Fidelity, JSON-First, KISS Over YAGNI, KADI Integration, Widget Pragmatism\n   - Detailed feature descriptions for all 7 systems (Registry, Inventory, Mining/Placement, UI, AI Agents, Menu, Sound Effects)\n   - 11 MVP validation items\n   - Success metrics and non-goals\n\n2. **tech.md** (~400 lines)\n   - Core technologies: C++20, DirectX 11, MSVC 2022, Windows x64\n   - Key dependencies: FMOD, Winsock2, nlohmann/json, KADI Broker, V8\n   - Application architecture: Multi-threaded chunk system, registry pattern, entity-component\n   - KADI WebSocket integration details (7-state connection, MCP tools with **PascalCase naming**)\n   - **MCP Tools (PascalCase):**\n     * SimpleMinerSpawnAgent(name, x, y, z)\n     * SimpleMinerMoveAgent(agentID, dirX, dirY, dirZ, duration)\n     * SimpleMinerMineBlock(agentID, x, y, z)\n     * SimpleMinerPlaceBlock(agentID, blockType, x, y, z)\n     * SimpleMinerGetAgentVision(agentID)\n     * SimpleMinerGetAgentInventory(agentID)\n     * SimpleMinerCraftItem(agentID, recipeID)\n   - Technical decisions with rationale:\n     * JSON over XML for registries\n     * KADI WebSocket over direct API\n     * Use existing WidgetSubsystem despite alpha quality\n     * Command queue over goal-based AI\n     * 2×2 crafting only (no 3×3 yet)\n   - Known limitations and technical debt (WidgetSubsystem, single-threaded game logic, no multiplayer, KADI external dependency, Windows-only)\n   - Performance requirements and bottlenecks\n\n3. **structure.md** (~450 lines)\n   - Complete directory tree with A7 new files marked\n   - File naming conventions (PascalCase classes, camelCase variables, m_ prefix)\n   - Code organization principles (SOLID, DI, composition over inheritance, const correctness)\n   - Module boundaries and dependency rules (Engine → Game one-way only)\n   - Layer architecture: Core Systems → Gameplay → UI → KADI Integration\n   - A7-specific file additions (8 new files in Gameplay, 4 in Definition, 3 in UI, 2 in KADI)\n\n**Changes in This Version:**\n- ✅ **MCP Tool Naming**: Updated all tool names from snake_case (simpleminer_spawn_agent) to PascalCase (SimpleMinerSpawnAgent)\n- ✅ **Consistency**: requirements.md and tech.md now use consistent PascalCase naming\n\n**Alignment with Requirements:**\n- All documents incorporate user feedback from requirements.md approval\n- JSON-first approach emphasized (per user's 3 explicit requests)\n- Sound effects included as FR-7 (per user request for AudioSystem integration)\n- KADI WebSocket integration detailed with 7-state connection flow\n- Widget system pragmatism acknowledged (\"very rough\" but functional)\n- Prerequisites order clarified: P-1 in design.md, P-2 and P-3 before design.md\n- **MCP tool names follow PascalCase convention per user request**\n\n**Files to Review:**\n- `.spec-workflow/steering/product.md`\n- `.spec-workflow/steering/tech.md` (updated with PascalCase tool names)\n- `.spec-workflow/steering/structure.md`\n\n**Next Steps After Approval:**\n- P-3 prerequisite will be complete\n- Ready to create design.md for A7 (which includes P-1: rendering bug fix solution)\n- Design phase can begin with full context from steering documents\n\n**Note:** These steering documents are project-wide and will guide not only A7 but also future assignments (A8, A9, etc.). They establish the foundational principles and architecture for SimpleMiner's ongoing development.",
