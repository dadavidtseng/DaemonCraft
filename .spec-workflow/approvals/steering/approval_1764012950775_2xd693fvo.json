  "description": "Requesting approval for **product.md** steering document (P-3 prerequisite, 1 of 3):\n\n**Document Overview:**\n- **Length**: ~350 lines\n- **Purpose**: Product vision and principles for Assignment 7\n\n**Key Content:**\n\n1. **Product Purpose**\n   - Transform SimpleMiner from terrain exploration sandbox into playable Minecraft-like voxel game with AI agent integration\n\n2. **5 Product Principles**\n   - **Minecraft Implementation Fidelity**: Every system must follow Minecraft patterns, not generic voxel game patterns\n   - **JSON-First Data Architecture**: All game data (blocks, items, recipes) must use JSON format\n   - **KISS Over YAGNI for MVP**: Prioritize simple, working implementations over future-proofing (tight deadline 12/12)\n   - **KADI Integration as First-Class Feature**: AI agent control is not an add-on but a core gameplay pillar\n   - **Widget Pragmatism**: Use existing WidgetSubsystem, refine only blocking features (defer comprehensive redesign)\n\n3. **Feature Scope**\n   - 7 major systems: Registry, Inventory, Mining/Placement, UI, AI Agents, Menu, Sound Effects\n   - 11 MVP validation items\n   - Clear non-goals (mobs, combat, health/hunger, particles, multiplayer, goal-based AI)\n\n4. **Success Metrics**\n   - Player can mine → craft → build cycle (Minecraft mechanics)\n   - Claude Desktop can spawn and control 3-10 AI agents via KADI WebSocket\n   - UI matches Minecraft visual style\n   - 60 FPS with inventory open and 3-10 agents\n\n**Alignment with Requirements:**\n- Reflects user feedback: JSON-first, Minecraft fidelity, sound effects (FR-7)\n- Establishes product direction for A7 and future assignments\n- Provides clear success criteria and non-goals\n\n**Next Steps After Approval:**\n- Review tech.md (technical architecture)\n- Review structure.md (code organization)\n- After all three approved, P-3 complete → proceed to design.md",
