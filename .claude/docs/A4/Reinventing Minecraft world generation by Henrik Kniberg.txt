hey welcome now welcome back uh so now
this could be a talk with henrik never
about i was a
terraforming minecraft but that was
maybe misreading it but anyway here is
hendrick kneebay welcome
this is going to be a pretty geeky talk
but this will be the right place to do a
geeky talk i guess right
yes good okay
i'm going to talk a bit about how code
and math and a bit of tinkering can lead
to really cool terrain
because i think it's interesting there
are no
uh takeaway points or learning points or
call to actions or anything in this talk
it's just sharing interesting knowledge
about how stuff works so if that's what
you want then you're in the right place
um
so
um minecraft is to some extent
an earth simulator
for those who have played it or watched
other play it you see this
thing that looks kind of like planet
earth
there's animals in there and trees and
rivers
and some things that aren't quite fully
realistic but
floating trees and
armless suicide bombers blowing up at
you some things we take some liberties
with realism but overall it is an
earth-like environment um
and
this is for those of you who wonder like
how how does that work like how do you
create
um an environment that kind of looks
like this
and um a bit of context we we changed
minecraft quite dramatically um about
well for the past two years we we in the
cave the cliffs update we basically
changed everything about world
generation
we added
much bigger caves
we added huge mountain ranges and as we
did this we realized that we can't just
add big caves in big mountains we have
to change the whole terrain to match and
we had a bunch of old legacy codes so it
was like okay this would be the right
time let's just rewrite most of it so
that's that's that's kind of what we did
and before i get into the nitty-gritty
details of how that how that works i
want to talk a little bit about size
because it's hard to really understand
how crazy big minecraft worlds are
um
this is earth
this round ball we're sitting on right
now
half a billion square kilometers of
surface roughly and over over there is a
minecraft world
flat
finite
about three and a half billion so about
seven times bigger than planet earth if
you're gonna explore a whole minecraft
world you'll need some time
and that's just one world every time you
create
every time you you create a new world in
minecraft
or you start a new game it generates a
unique world just for you
the likelihood of someone else seeing
this exact world is very low it's one in
18 quintillion
and a quintillion is a one with 18 zeros
so that's an 18 with 18 zeros that's how
many different possible worlds there are
and each of those worlds is seven times
the size of earth so it's it's big and
just to put that into perspective
i told you it's going to be geeky
milk away galaxy 100 billion planets ish
minecraft 18 quintillion worlds if every
minecraft world was a planet we would
need
how many milky ways 180 million milky
ways size galaxies just to fit those so
if you're gonna explore all the possible
minecraft content
yeah it'll again it'll take time
um what's interesting is of course
minecraft is not a physical world it's
it's a digital thing but even digital
worlds take physical space
uh so let's let's do that math a little
bit
um a minecraft world is a grid of blocks
right
kind of like a like a rubik's cube where
every block is one meter
uh but a rubik's cube is three times
three times three a minecraft world is
60 million times 60 million times 384
it's a big rubik's cube
and a minecraft world is kind of from a
data storage perspective a list of
blocks right what block do we place at
what position that's kind of what it is
and it adds up in data so one minecraft
minecraft world roughly
that's not me
is about 97 000 terabytes so 97 million
gigabytes i guess if my math is right
is one world
um it wouldn't fit on any disk the
biggest disk i could find was it was 100
terabytes so that's you know pretty
small in comparison you can't fit a
minecraft
a single minecraft world on a disk and
of course definitely can't fit all of
them um you would need that many bytes
i'm not going to say that number
i don't know it doesn't have a name
um
the whole earth data sphere that's a new
word i learned for this talk data sphere
is how much total data storage on earth
is roughly like that so you would need
about 238 238 trillion worlds earth's to
store all the minecraft worlds
digitally so yeah it's big even if you
just look at disk space
so then how the heck can the download be
just a half a gig
right
um
well obviously
the download of minecraft does not
contain any worlds it's actually empty
it only contains code to generate the
world so i like to think of it kind of
like there's no body it's just a dna to
generate the body right
and that's kind of interesting because
it's like okay but how does that work
and it is somewhat of an illusion we try
to make this not noticeable to players
so when i'm running around inside my
world it feels like that world was
always there
but actually it's generating as i move
around and if you move really fast you
can kind of see it happening right
so over there in the background it's not
loading the world it's generating the
world it's calculating it
so makes you kind of wonder right maybe
it's like that in reality too
right if you point your telescope to
some unexplored area of the universe is
that being generated just there for you
who knows if it happens here maybe it
happens there right
just generated on demand
and that's what we call procedural
terrain generation
makes sense so far
to those who work with this stuff you're
like duh this is obvious those have not
worked with it maybe it's like oh that's
really interesting some of you might be
in between i don't know but even though
i work a lot with this i still i still
find the naive strong interest in this
it's just fun
but okay so what is this thing
procedural terrain generation in
minecraft we generate chunk by chunk so
this is one chunk 16 by 16 wide and then
full height that's one chunk we generate
one chunk at a time
and
um
when we talk about procedural trained
animation what is the procedure right
the word procedure what are we talking
about and that's pretty much this right
the procedure of asking hey what block
should be here at this coordinate and
the procedure says
you know planks okay put planks right so
it's really just answering the question
what should i place here
and um for example flower over there
right dirt
stone etc
and for those who don't know the
coordinate system in minecraft x is x
and z are the horizontal components and
the y is the vertical component so
this is the procedure doing its job
um but one challenge is that as we
generate a chunk we want that chunk to
fit with the next chunk
right it should fit together
seamlessly and maybe this is my world
today and then i start playing minecraft
for five years then i start playing
minecraft again and i run off to the
west it keeps generating and it fits
magically so that's a big challenge to
make all trunks fit together seamlessly
even across different versions of the
game
but i won't talk about that so much in
this talk um
so yeah uh a chunk right that i made the
trunk a bit wider just to just uh
illustrate but a chunk is generated in
steps
so first step is terrain shaping which
is really just deciding stone and air so
for every position there's going to be
either a stone block or an air block an
air block it's invisible so then it
looks like this right
it's kind of first step and then at a
later step we do water filling so we
decide that okay
all blocks below y level 64 or whatever
is going to be filled with water and
then we get oceans and rivers
and next is surface replacement so let
me look at what biomed is is this a
jungle or is it a desert and then based
on that we replace the top layer with
something so dirt grass
and finally features and structures so
uh yeah um the
villages trees oars things like that so
it's done in multiple steps
but in this talk i'll focus mostly on on
the first step the actual you know stone
and air the shaping of the train
and as you can see that also includes
caves right if we leave some air on the
ground that becomes caves
all right
yeah
show me the code
i'm not going to show so much actual
code because a i'm not sure i'm allowed
to and b there's lots of icky stuff in
there performance optimizations and
stuff that we don't need to get caught
up in so i'll just show simplified kind
of pseudo code
um
what would be a like if we start from
scratch right let's do procedural world
generation from scratch what might that
look like
so
simple function
random right
so the world generation system asks what
should i place here and the answer is
flip a coin and then okay stone or air
if we do that
our trunks look like this
right
um not terribly fun
uh kind of hard to play the game but it
is possible you can run around in there
you might get stuck but
this is technically procedural world
generation right it is a chunk being
generated procedurally so
you know you have to start small right
um but it would be nice to have some
kind of a surface to run around on so
let's change it instead and introduce a
fixed terrain height
so we'll say that
uh let's say that the y level 100 that's
the surface right and then the answer to
the question should be stone air well if
we're below y100 it's done otherwise
it's air boom now we have surface right
so i can i can actually you know i can
run around inside this world now as
opposed to before that's a good start i
just need to be careful so i don't fall
off the edge
um and if i apply surface decoration and
then make the world a bit bigger then
yeah i can run around here
it is a bit boring it's very flat
uh but it is a procedurally generated
world
okay we want random terrain height so
let's let's randomize that surface wire
right so surface y equals 100 which is
our base height plus a random number
from 0 to 19.
okay now what
um
oh yeah as i mentioned before simplified
code just make it easier to read
but yeah this is what we get
uh kind of a mess right that's because
every single block has a random height
so there's no continuity
but there is a surface now and and it is
procedural
and random
okay
so
we need to we need to step up our game
here a little bit this is not really you
know ending up where we want it um
how do we get smooth terrain
so looking into the world of math what
is there that's smooth well there's this
thing right called a sine curve that's
kind of nice and smooth
if we think of that as a as a terrain
looking from the side we have valleys
and hills and
and sign curves are cool because they
continue forever they never end right
you can keep scrolling and it'll just
keep going and it's always seamlessly
smooth and fits together
so this is something in the right
direction let's play with this
right go to the code and say 100 plus
sine x but that's a very small number
negative one to one so let's amplify it
a little bit times 10. so
somewhere between the 90 and 110
now what happens
okay
we we have a signed terrain but now i
can it's looking a little bit more like
a train maybe not quite as crazy but i
want to configure this a little bit it's
it's too uh
yeah it's just too uneven
so let's make some variables frequency
amplitude right
um and applying those we can say that i
want i want the slopes to be a little
bit further apart and a little bit
higher or lower or whatever
and now we're starting to get a little
smoother shape
but a little bit
too
2d maybe
so let's actually make a two-dimensional
we'll do the same thing but instead of
only in x dimension we do it in the z
dimension also
and i won't go through that code in
detail but basically
um
same thing but it but in in two
directions and that gives us um these
yeah nice little hills
this started to kind of look a little
bit like a world maybe
what do you think
so far the best right at least i think
so
and
yeah let's add water so we check if we
are below sea level place water instead
of air very simple and then look now the
dolphins are moving in now they're happy
they have a cool place to be
and a bit of surface decoration on that
and
yeah this is kind of cool
i think this is kind of cool
it does get a bit repetitive though
there's something missing here and that
thing is randomness right all the worlds
will look the same
so
that brings us to the next chapter
purlin noise
purlin is this guy ken perlin
he came up with a cool trick a bunch of
years ago
where you basically can take instead of
like if imagine an old television
television set with like noise so
there's random dots here right so for
any given coordinate if that's x and
that's why we pick a color right and
that's random so it's just a mess well
he came up with a mathematical trick
that turns this into that instead so it
changes gradually instead of you know
white black white black white white
black it goes very white kind of gray
kind of black and back towards white and
gradually changes so it's like you've
been smudging this like with a rag or
something
it's a really nice mathematical trick
and there's other variants of it
simplex noise there's some people call
this i think value noise i don't know
i'm just going to use the term pearly
noise for now because that's kind of
where it started
so the basic idea is two inputs in this
case if it's a 2d noise and one output
so ask a question for this coordinate x
z
what what number do i get a number comes
out and i choose a a shade of of white
depending on that color it's a 2d noise
field a 1d noise field is the same thing
but it's just one input instead
so in this case the input is an x an x
value so for each x value
i get a y value and that y value changes
smoothly so it doesn't go like that it
changes smoothly so this is just
different ways of visualizing perlin
noise the cool thing about it though is
that you don't have to use it for
terrain generation you can use it for
pretty much anything it's very useful
for games
so maybe i use this as a let's say i'm
playing a two-dimensional side-scroller
game i could use a function like this to
decide
where are the aliens in the game right
there are a lot of aliens here none over
here or maybe the you know how many
trees are there in that place or
whatever it is how much gold am i going
to find it's just a way of creating
randomness that changes gradually
pretty useful
but of course in this case we're using
this for terrain generation
so i'm not going to talk about how
perlin noise works because that's even a
little bit more geeky than i had planned
for this talk plus uh time plus i'm not
very good at explaining it so google it
but um so let's just abstract it there
are lots of
libraries that do this so let's just
package it behind the black box and say
perlin noise give me a number right so
that's what we're doing here we're
saying dear pearl and noise please give
me a number between negative one and one
based on these two inputs
and that's what it's gonna do
amplify it a little bit add it to the
base surface
and what happens
well
this is kind of cool
right a little more random
it changes gradually as we move around
of course we can tweak it a little bit
maybe increase amplitude i don't know
but this is kind of a good foundation
right for terrain generation
um what i showed there was a single
octave noise so what is an octave well
if you think of this take the sine curve
as an example again right
in my mind purlin noise is the sine
curve but a little bit randomly
distorted but it's easier to think about
it as a sine curve so it goes up and
down like this
octave means add another curve
so we got this one over here y equals
sine x and we got this one here y equals
sine of four x divided by four so we're
increasing the frequency so we get more
more hills and we're reducing the
amplitude so they're shorter and why
would we do that
well because if we add these together
we get
like a valley and a hill it's still a
valley on a hill like it was from the
beginning this red line but now it's a
valley and a hill with local variation
so there's a hill but a little bit of a
dip there and there's a valley but a
little bit up there so you get this kind
of high level train shape and then kind
of more gradual low-level terrain shape
on top of it it's a really really simple
and beautiful mathematical trick
so if we had a third octave
pretty cool right
to start to look like a proper valley in
a proper mountain
and what's interesting is there's no
randomness here even this is just sine
curves so you can see the potential
right
okay so let's do octaves on on on
parallel noise so this is an actual purl
noise output right x is the input y is
output so imagine this being a terrain
going up and down and the second add a
second octave to it add a third octave
to it the terrain just becomes more
interesting and varied
and this can be tuned of course like a
typical thing you do for an octave is
double the frequency and half the
amplitude but you can tweak those
numbers
all right
uh
so let's do it
let's pretend that this perlin noise can
do octaves because all it's doing is
sampling multiple times sampling four
times adding them together right so
that's kind of the only change i did
here and already the terrain is looking
even more interesting
it's not it's not it's it's really about
creating variation our goal is to to
create a world where exploring is fun
even without any other content just
exploring should be fun and interesting
you shouldn't just see the same same all
the time that's kind of the design goal
okay so this is looking nice right i
just added the sea level and the the
terrain features and the biomes
it's looking quite nice for let's say 10
15 minutes maybe 30 minutes i can go
around here and go like wow this is so
cool but then after all i'll be like
it's kind of looking the same still
though
it's random but it's the same ish it
goes a little bit up a little bit down
you know
so there's something missing like where
is
where is the drama right
we want drama we want this
so how do we get randomness but how do
we control the randomness just to some
extent
oh perfect timing see thing is i just
stand up by the way just have a second
i spammed videos into my talk thinking
that was a good idea well guess what
that does to the powerpoint file it
makes it massive so my my thing started
crashing i had to split it into two
different decks
so i figure you guys can stretch while i
open the next deck how about that
we get to part two
all right
all right i hope you feel revitalized
[Laughter]
let's take some drinks too
so terrain
what's that oh terrain shape oh terrain
shaping is um
is the process of taking this randomness
and taming it you know adding a little
bit of control to it while still letting
it be random
i don't know if it's official thing it's
just what we call it internally um
terrain shaping so noise transformation
is when you take a noise like that
sampling it over there right gives us
value from negative one to one and then
doing something to it
so multiplying by 20 and adding 100
that's a transformation and it gave us
gives us in this case some kind of
terrain
so let's do more deliberate noise
transformation we're going to take
our noise our pearly noise and i'm going
to call it something i'm going to call
it continentalness i could call it you
know uncle bob it doesn't matter but we
use that as a mental metaphor for what
it's supposed to mean right and we'll
get more to that later so we give the
noise a name
and everywhere in the world has a value
for continentalness
so as i'm running around i can see that
value change right in this flat world
and now to the shaping really means
creating an indirect connection between
continentalness and terrain height by
putting dots on the graph
so in this case i'll start very simple
and say that let's say that continental
negative one
maps to terrain height of 100
and then i add a second dot over here
saying that continentalness of one also
maps to terrain height of 100.
okay and this is our our our spline our
like we fit a curve to these dots right
not very hard to do
and this gives us what
a boring flat world again right here we
are saying that i don't care what
continentalness is it's the surface
height is always going to be 100. okay
but this is to illustrate the kind of
tool so now we can play around right
let's say that higher continentalness
means higher terrain elevation
like that
and then
we're back to our nice purlin noise you
know surface that we kind of saw before
um because now continentalness is
directly mapped to to terrain height
so let's let's goof around a little bit
let's add a threshold here and say that
well here it's kind of smooth but from
when continental goes from 0.3 to 0.4
we're going to see a jump in terrain
height and after that it's going to
flatten out
so we're
making it like not symmetrical
now it's interesting
right the purlin noise varies quite
smoothly but the terrain height doesn't
it has jumps so now you get these really
cool things like these plateaus and when
you add a bit of surface decoration yeah
you start some getting getting some a
lot more interesting terrain right a lot
more variation
just by moving the dots around
so we decided to do this on steroids
we had um
three noises here so continental erosion
and something we call peaks and valleys
and we can figure them differently so as
you see erosion changes quite slowly
this one tends to generate ridges we've
just configured it in that way
and this one tends to generate
they're just a little different and they
represent different things in the world
so as i run around
i see values for all three noises right
and you can actually um as a player if
you play on the job addition of the game
you play a single player you can press
f3 and you can see this pile of debug
nonsense and if you dig into that
here multi-noise c stands for
continentalness e stands for erosion
that stands for peaks and valleys so you
can kind of see basically these numbers
as you run around the world and you can
see what it does to the terrain
so that gives us very interesting
terrain
like plateaus like this river valleys or
you know big mountain ranges
because we basically create a lot of
these spline points so this is the
actual code pretty much what we
configured we're saying that
continentalness when it's low
this is supposed to represent kind of
how far inland are we that's the mental
model right high continentalists we're
far inland low continentalness means
we're kind of offshore so that's why as
we are low here offshore terrain height
goes way down below sea level and that's
how we get oceans so this single thing
basically creates oceans and minecraft
it's pretty interesting
and here we get kind of the coastline
coming in and then as we go further up
the scale we suddenly get plateaus
and here it smooths out
but these points
lead to other splines too so we're
saying that when continentalness is over
here
terrain height is there but only if the
other noises are at zero
because then we have other splines
connected to it so we're saying that but
if erosion let's say is low then guess
what boom the train height gets even
higher if erosion is high turning gets
lower
and same thing there each dot here is
connected to yet another one over here
saying that in general peaks and valleys
will generate well peaks and valleys
this is super complicated to explain in
fact i've forgotten multiples a while
ago it's kind of mind-bending but when
you sit with it you move the dots around
look what happens in the world it
becomes clear for a little while until
you go to lunch then you forget it all
again right
but it's interesting the main thing
though is that you don't need to write
tons of code to change your train you
can move these dots around
which also makes it kind of mod like mod
friendly people outside mojang can
tinker with these numbers you can do
that you can make a cool world right
by by changing these numbers so
uh yeah this is an example this area in
the world has high peaks and valleys so
we see uh yeah peaks here for example it
has high continentalness we're far
inland this is a lake actually and we
have low erosion which generally creates
more mountainous regions so that
together causes these steep mountain
ridges
this area of the world has high erosion
which means it's going to be kind of
flat no matter what
else
so all this is done via spline points it
creates an enormous amount of variation
um so here we see an example of a lake a
mountain range here so flat area we want
to cater to all playstyles some players
want to build a castle on a mountain
others just want a flat area to be able
to run their horses on right others want
to have lots of rivers to explore the
world through so the d is that if you
don't like what you see just keep
traveling because you're almost
certainly going to find something that
you like after a while because there's
just almost infinite variation in there
uh okay so these three noises kind of
together uh generate this is a like a
map of the world and as you can see a
lot of variation these are high
mountains rivers coastlines deep ocean
things like that
yeah move the dots around changes the
terrain
you can also mess things up quite easily
this actually happened by accident i
changed a few numbers in the wrong way
and then oops maybe we shouldn't ship
this version i don't know
i still don't remember exactly how it
happened but
um
of course what i'm showing now is just
the base terrain shape and the
interesting bit of course happens when
you add the biomes
right so biomes are kind of like the
paint
on on the surface to make the world
really interesting
these are fjords
uh i worked on fjords does anybody write
hitchhiker's guide to galaxy
i uh i did not win a prize for the
fjords i'm very disappointed i wish i
won a prize for the shorts uh but it was
very very uh hitchhiker guide moment at
that time um
okay so i've kind of oversimplified
things a little bit for you um
because let me just check the time here
yeah
uh this all the stuff i showed you so
far is just to generate the high level
surface like roughly where is the
where is
you know where's the terrain right now
down here up there right so kind of low
fidelity terrain height changes the
actual details are controlled by
something else which is called 3d noise
and i consider not including this
because kind of hard to explain but i'm
going to try but if you don't get it
don't feel stupid it is kind of hard to
explain in like three minutes but i'll
try 3d noise okay so what you're seeing
here is really the result of 3d noise
layered on top of the terrain shaping
and
the reason why we need it is because of
this you can't get this kind of crazy
minecraft terrain using just
purlin noise here we have overhangs and
all kinds of weirdness happening and
this is what minecraft is kind of famous
for this kind of total you know
wackiness that can happen and we really
want to keep it
so how does 3d noise generate this
well
3d noise three inputs one output
so the inputs are the coordinate of the
world right
an output is a value and we call that
value density just a mental model for
what it's supposed to be
um so imagine that this is all the
the positions in the world and each
position has a value and pretend this is
3d okay
so every position has a density value
and all we care about is whether it's
positive or negative so it gradually
changes
as as we you know in different parts of
the world but there's a threshold when
it goes from positive to negative and we
basically we basically defined that
anything that is zero or negative is
going to be air
and everything if that's positive is
going to be stone that's why we use the
term density right negative density
there's nothing there so it's air
positive density there's something there
let's put stone right it has no
implication in the gameplay itself it's
just a world generation kind of
technique
but when we create when we create a
world using just this algorithm we get
this
i did a side slice of the world you get
a world that is just stone and air and
all the air parts here was where density
happened to be negative
and because it's a purlin noise giving
us these values it changes gradually
right
okay why are we doing this right well it
looks cool maybe that's a good enough
reason
but we then apply a uh
a bias to it so the higher up we are the
more we lower the density value and the
lower down we are the more we increase
the density values we do an adjustment
to it and that pretty much squashes it a
little bit so it pretty much says that
up here mostly air down here is mostly
stone and here's the place where density
actually would would make a difference
right
so why do we do that well that's how we
generate the the
the actual terrain um the detailed
surface of the world because terrain
shape is controlled by
two things squashing factor and height
offset squashing factor is what i just
showed you
this is an example of high squashing
factor where we with that bias is very
strong
so it's basically almost like a flat
world but as we relax that bias
right we reduce squashing factor then
the 3d noise is allowed to be shown
right
so
i'm reducing squashing factor now and as
you can see
lower squashing factor means more
madness right
and the other value height offset is
just literally moving everything up or
down right but those two numbers just
those two numbers have a radical effect
on the world
so that's how we kind of spice up the
world
uh in practice we can figure that the
same way using splines so we define how
continentalness and all these other
noises
basically add points for uh squashing
factor and we add points for terrain
elevation just like everything else
so those things together give us a mix
of madness
and kind of more normal looking terrain
and i guess kind of this is where the
the mix between realism and fantasy
comes into play right 3d noise kind of
gives a fantasy element well the the
terrain shaping gives us more kind of
realism to it
and we want to be inspired by realism
but not limited by it
okay so a bit about cave generation then
this is these are the new big bigger
caves we made
and they are generated essentially using
3d noise as well
so i'm going to talk a bit about that
aquifer this underground water is was a
whole separate chapter that would take
about half a day to explain it was so
freaking difficult but i'm really glad
it's over
but uh okay noise field this is a noise
field
um imagine that let's just do a 2d
version of the world just to understand
this better right we want to make caves
in a 2d version of the world here's a
noise field um 2d noise and of course
white and black is the is the perlino's
output
let's just decide that white is air
and black is stone similar to what i
showed you before right we decide that
white is air black is stone
if we do that
and apply that to this little 2d world
then we get a cave system right we get
well not a cave system independent in
not connected chambers here in this case
right
that's really
it
it's cave generation is easier than the
other stuff um
we call these cheese caves
because they kind of look like swiss
cheese when you look at that map
and they tend to generate these big
chambers
um
and kind of yeah
big chambers in in the caves however we
notice that we do a little bit of
transformation to make it a little
flatter to make it possible to run
around there's some tweaking we do but
basically it's it's that that's the base
so we call them cheese caves because
they looked a bit like cheese and then
the name stuck and yeah the rest is
history
but we but what we didn't get from this
was long tunnels
so to get along tunnels after a lot of
experimentation
and i want to emphasize that everything
i'm showing you here none of it was
obvious to anyone we have to do a lot of
head banging to really find it so it's
really easy to underestimate how hard it
is to change the core of a game in this
way
so it's kind of risky and stressful
but i'm glad it worked out really well
but anyway um
in this case we have another noise field
and we just find that the border between
black and white that's going to be
errors we kind of take another approach
now so that's why that's black here is
the exactly that shade of gray is going
to be air
the rest is going to be stone
if we do that we essentially get
spaghetti
so we call these spaghetti caves like
long winding tunnels it's a little
different in 3d there's a little more we
have to do for 3d but i don't have time
to explain that but the basic principle
is the same
this is called uh noise ridging
because yeah we can go back to the
algorithm there it's really just take
the absolute value of of the of the
noise and if it's less than a certain
constant then
it's cave right so yeah that's these
um so-called spaghetti caves we have a
thin version of them that we call noodle
caves
and what's cool is when we combine these
things that's when the magic happens
right you take these caverns and you
take these long tunnels and you mix them
all up
and you get incredibly interesting and
varied cave systems you can just keep
exploring even as a developer when we ex
when i run around inside the cage i just
keep getting surprised even though i
spent so much time
like working with it so it's really
interesting how much variation you can
get when you have enough variables that
are kind of interplaying
okay last bit
biomes
if we have time i think we do
right
so minecraft world is divided into
biomes right so here we have a jungle
and then over there we have some planes
or savannah
and
as i mentioned before think of it kind
of like a thin layer on top of the
terrain
so for example that would be the jungle
or
in the jungle we have jungle trees and a
lot of grass and stuff and desert a lot
of sand right so biomes control things
like what what's the surface material
what's the color of the water
and also things like what structures
show up there right in deserts you can
find desert temples
in cold areas you can find
igloos
so it has a pretty big impact on
gameplay experience
and i'll i'll give an example of the
same location
now i made the whole world just desert
so everything's desert
now exact same terrain shape but
meadows instead
now there's a village that decided to
show up for some reason
exact same location
grove
um and here you see by the the interplay
of the cave the cave generation and the
terrain generation when the caves poke
out you get cave entrances it's
interesting
uh badlands which is very characteristic
and then uh here is a swamp you normally
won't see swamps up in the mountains but
hey i made a swamp world so this is what
we got
um
and jungle so yeah uh biom biomes have a
big impact on gameplay
so how do we place them right how do we
decide what biome to place where
um so i'll talk a bit about that
um
they're based on
five noises so we have these three
noises already mentioned then we have
two more which we use for placement so
temperature and humidity it doesn't
actually mean temperature minecraft
doesn't have heat you're not gonna like
start sweating when you go there it's
just a kind of a metaphor
and the combination of those values
decide which pile so now now we have
five numbers here and they're all
changing as you move around
and depending on what those numbers say
they would we hit certain thresholds and
it goes boom no more badlands now we
want
savannah because it got more humid i
guess
or maybe it got a little cooler i don't
remember but one of these things hit a
threshold
so these we configure using tables
because biomes are are discrete you're
either in desert or planes you can't be
kind of in both so it's discrete
therefore we use we don't use splines we
use tables
so this shows this shows a table if
we're in an area where peak noise is
high
then we look at continentalness and
erosion and that decides which biome
we're in
to make this easier to configure we
split the noise values into number
ranges so we said that you know
erosion 0 means a value from negative 1
to negative 0.78
right
erosion 6 means 0.55 to 1. just to be
able to reason reason about it so that's
what this zero means here it's that
number range
and then we basically say that okay
um let's say uh this place i'm in right
now is far inland
and um um quite like it sorry it has a
high continental value
and it has low erosion
so then this basically lookup table says
all right there's going to be a peak
here
okay but what kind of peak there's
different types of peaks well that
depends on temperature
so in this case high continentals low
erosion low temperature means jagged
peaks it's these snowy things right and
this is independent of of terrain
shaping
or semi-independent we've configured
them we've configured them to
somewhat match so when the biome is
going to be a mountainous biome terrain
shaping is configured to generate
mountainous terrain but they're not hard
coupled it's more like a soft coupling
via the configuration
but anyway so we travel a bit and here
we come across a jungle so how did it
decide that that's gonna be a jungle
well in this case we were
low continentalness and medium erosion
so this is going to be a middle biome
and what the heck is a middle biome
so we look at that table
and that table says well okay it's a
middle biome huh
and humidity is high and temperature is
kind of high so it's wet kind of hot
okay let's put a jungle there right so
we could have called these noises noise
a noise b noise c but using these words
like humidity and temperature it just
makes it easier for us humans to
actually understand what the heck we're
talking about when we're configuring
this stuff in the code
but it is it is a metaphor and it's not
a perfect metaphor like for example it
says wet here and yet there's a desert
doesn't quite make sense
but we're not optimizing 100 realism
we're mainly optimizing for in this case
having deserts be rather big
but this gives us a lot of flexibility
um
so yeah here's our jungle
so these five noises together
generate in this case uh this is a map
of the biomes in the world right you see
that there's a lot of interesting
variation cold area here
hot area with badlands and desert
there's a coastal region with some
beaches or there's a massive swamp
um
it gives each part of the world its own
characteristic so here we go big beaches
um configuring this is tricky because
you need to understand what you need to
think you need to visualize a five
dimensional grid
what's what's hard about it why does it
matter because neighbors matter a lot we
don't want a desert to neighbor for
example
snowy peaks it just looks ridiculous so
we when we configure these tables we
think a lot about what biomes could
neighbor which biomes but it's a
five-dimensional configuration space so
each
each cell has ten neighbors which makes
it really hard but what's interesting is
after a while when you sit and work with
this your head gets warped enough so you
start seeing things in five as a
five-dimensional grid and you get brain
damaged so for for a while i was a bit
brain-damaged i could be you know
outside looking at a slope there and
seeing numbers in my head
luckily i think i've recovered from that
now feeling less messed up
but yeah this kind of thing i drew this
if you stare at long enough you either
understand or you go insane one of those
two things happen
no guarantees offered
okay wrap up as i mentioned
there are no takeaways it's up to you
what your takeaways are this is just me
sharing what i thought think is
interesting about terrain generation but
i guess if anything it's if you play
minecraft it might be fun to think about
like hey now i know why there's a
mountain there or if you have kids or
friends who play minecraft you can show
off and say oh yeah i can see that must
be a low erosion area over here that
you're in they're like what i don't know
but also maybe you work in other areas
maybe you work in game development or
other areas where some of these
techniques might be useful
most of the stuff i talked about here is
not unique to minecraft a lot of these
techniques are quite commonly used in
other games as well
so but i just wanted to share
yeah share what we've been doing and
what we've been learning
so yeah thanks a lot
[Applause]
so thank you very much i think we have
time for questions
miraculously we do
anybody have any questions yeah okay
let's start closer did you consider any
other alternatives i mean like using
machine learning
so the question was did we consider
other alternatives such as machine
learning and yes we did a lot of
exploration in the beginning of this
update
um one big consideration is is
performance since the world is generated
on the fly if we could pre-generate a
world our options would be much wider
but yeah performance was probably the
biggest thing that pushed us in this
direction
so questions
oh no you saw the weirdness did you darn
it
yeah that weirdness is an always too um
weirdness is a weird noise um it's it's
a it's a noise that is used to generate
let's say we have a jungle but sometimes
it's a bamboo jungle
well that's because weirdness was
negative
so it's it creates variance
it's also used to generate in some cases
awareness is used as a noise that
indirectly influences peaks and valleys
so when awareness hits certain
thresholds you suddenly get a river or a
peak it's kind of weird that's why it's
called weirdness we couldn't come up
with a better term um but
yeah good question good nice job
spotting it yeah
yeah 3d biomes is an interesting
question we had a lot of
trouble trying to figure out what to do
with that thing is
before caves and cliffs update there
were no cave biomes
so
biomes were 2d if you're in planes it's
going to be planes no matter how high or
low you go
now you might be in planes and you go
into a cave and suddenly there's a lush
cave down there which is a different
biome
so we struggled a lot with how to make
that work in a consistent way and we
pretty much ended up with having
all normal surface biomes be 2d they go
all the way from top to bottom of the
world and then we inject 3d biomes just
for the caves
so saying that okay this this 3d area is
going to be drip stone caves with
stelling my stalactites but everything
above and below is going to be planes
but that's been very tricky because if
initially we thought we would use 3d
biomes for everything
but then we got really weird things
where i'm building my house
and i you know and and i'm placing some
blocks and suddenly the grass color
changes 10 blocks higher up
why well because there's a jungle in the
sky
right it's planes here but there's a
jungle in the sky but i can't see it
because it's just air
and it's just
we've got all these weird educates we're
kind of like screw it
biomes are 2d unless they're caves and
they're 3d it's a bit of a compromise
but the technology for it is there so we
might
go back to making 3d models in the
future once we figured out the design of
it because it was really that we didn't
have time to figure out the implications
of the design implications of it
these are super cool questions by the
way
the world right what actually happens it
would actually happen in this particular
um it's a little bit different on our
different platforms java and bedrock but
but in the job edition of the game
once you explore a part of the world it
generates that chunk and saves it
so generation is a one-time thing
and then every time you change a block
it just saves that
so the world is persistent in a sense
i think in bedrock it's a little bit
different but
yeah it's a very interesting question
because some some other games don't do
that right
i'm sure some of you how many work in
game development i'm just curious
um
oh wait i thought sweden was the mecca
for game companies nobody works in game
development here
well that's interesting wow a few maybe
anyway but
a pretty common thing is that you just
throw the delta
so it's basically saying that uh henrik
added eight you know
dirt blocks here and that's all it saves
and the next time you go there it
regenerates that chunk and
applies that change
i'm not an expert on that kind of stuff
i can see advantages and disadvantages
but i would say probably mostly for
historical reasons
minecraft stores the chunk permanently
once you've generated it
yeah up there thank you
yes
yeah so the question was about about uh
or generation right because in minecraft
well it's called minecraft you go mining
you find ores and because we made the
world bigger i didn't mention that but
with this update we made the world
basically you know 50
higher and deeper so everything is
bigger which means we need to fill the
world with something right what if i go
dig deep there needs to be something
there and it basically forced us to
completely redo the balance of which
ores generate where
we took the opportunity to try to make
that more interesting but the way ores
are placed we actually didn't really
change that like
basically at a high level for each chunk
it randomly decides how many placements
of iron are there going to be here based
on a configuration let's say it decides
that there's going to be five blobs of
iron and then it pretty much just rolls
dice okay let's try to place one down
here
oh i can't there's air there okay never
mind i'll try to place over here ocean
darn it skip that what about here oh
here there's stone let's shoot in some
iron ore so it's old tech
new configuration pretty much
uh did we change other dimensions
minecraft has dimensions right what i
showed you now was the kind of the main
dimension called the overworld then
there's other dimensions um such as the
another and the end and we didn't do
anything with that at all we didn't
touch it um maybe in the future
thing is last update the update before
this update was a total overhaul of the
nether so we tend to try to create a
focus area for an update um
yeah do you have plans to fix the
gravity issue you chop down a tree and
it falls down
that's interesting if we did we'd
probably be uh crucified
because it's kind of part of minecraft's
image that you have these dumb trees
hanging in the air it's also completely
inconsistent because you can place a
stone that hangs in there but if you
play sand it falls down it makes no
sense but it's become kind of iconic so
it's probably going to stay that way and
it's my guess but i don't know
oh yeah that's a really good question
yeah as i showed you the chunks go from
the bottom to the top
right and that's a terrible waste of
resources because if i'm running around
on the surface why should i generate
terrain down way way below that i'm
maybe probably not going to see 99 of
the time and that's an absolute waste of
time which you didn't have time to fix
because it's the whole chunk thing is so
deeply ingrained in the code that
changing that making chunks 3d would be
a huge and costly and difficult change
which maybe in the future someday but we
decided that now we won't have time to
do it now we just have to pay the price
of generating wasteful stuff down there
all right go ahead you pick
slime okay this is very you know it's
like specific minecrafter questions so
the rest of you might be like what's
that slime chunk
slime chunk is some chunks uh
like we'll spawn slimes
and we don't change anything with that
like 10 of chunks in general are slime
chunks and they will spawn slimes and it
still is that way just like before
um
so we we changed almost everything about
train generation but try to change as
little as possible else
how finely granular yeah minecraft we
have these they're one meter big right
it's pretty low low fidelity um and it's
kind of weird like why you know why is
performance a challenge in a game that
is built on blocks
uh but the big challenge in minecraft
that makes it a performance sensitive
product is that a we want to work on
cheap computers
right we have like very many players we
want them to keep playing the game even
if they don't have a high-end computer
so that's one consideration but then the
fact that minecraft is a dynamic world
the player can change things so from a
code perspective it's really hard to
optimize anything we can't pre-calculate
light for example because i might put a
torch
i might build a redstone contraption
that moves everything back and forth
so so the fact that everything is
changeable in the world and the fact
that it's generated dynamically as you
go means that it's really hard to
optimize
plus the fact that now we made the world
bigger so performance is actually always
always a a challenge even though it
looks like a very blocky you know it
looks like it might be simple but it's
actually a lot more tricky than it might
seem
okay i think that was the last question
thank you very much
all right thank you very much
