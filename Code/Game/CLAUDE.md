## Assignment 4 Context: World Generation

**Status:** Phase 5A - Carvers (Ravines/Rivers) ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETED (Date Unknown)

This module has been indirectly affected by Assignment 4 as the [Framework module](Framework/CLAUDE.md) and [Gameplay module](Gameplay/CLAUDE.md) underwent significant changes for procedural world generation. The [App class](Framework/CLAUDE.md) manages the JobSystem that executes world generation jobs.

**Completed Changes:**
- ✅ New block types integrated from updated sprite sheets ([Definition module](Definition/CLAUDE.md))
- ✅ Enhanced chunk generation with 3D density terrain in [Framework](Framework/CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Biome system fully operational affecting [World class](Gameplay/CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ ImGui debug interface added to [Game class](Gameplay/CLAUDE.md) for Phase 2 testing
- ✅ Complete surface blocks and tree features system implemented in [Framework](Framework/CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Cross-chunk tree placement with thread-safe neighbor chunk modifications
- ✅ Comprehensive biome coverage with surface height detection and storage
- ✅ Cave carving system with cheese (caverns) and spaghetti (tunnels) implemented in [Framework](Framework/CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Ravine and river carvers with 2D noise paths implemented in [Framework](Framework/CLAUDE.md)

## Module Responsibilities

The Game module serves as the primary entry point and core logic container for SimpleMiner. It manages the application lifecycle, game state, and coordinates between the custom engine and game-specific functionality. This module defines build preferences, handles Windows platform initialization, and orchestrates the main game systems.

See [Framework module](Framework/CLAUDE.md) for core systems implementation and [Gameplay module](Gameplay/CLAUDE.md) for game-specific logic.

## Entry and Startup

### Primary Entry Point
- **File**: [Framework/Main_Windows.cpp](Framework/CLAUDE.md)
- **Function**: `WinMain()` - Windows application entry point
- **Process**:
  1. Creates [App](Framework/CLAUDE.md) instance (`g_app = new App()`)
  2. Calls `App::Startup()` for initialization
  3. Runs main game loop via `App::RunMainLoop()`
  4. Handles shutdown and cleanup

### Application Architecture
- **[App Class](Framework/CLAUDE.md)** (`Framework/App.hpp/cpp`): Main application controller
  - Manages game lifecycle (startup, main loop, shutdown)
  - Initializes JobSystem with specialized worker threads
    - 1 dedicated I/O worker thread (for [ChunkLoadJob, ChunkSaveJob](Gameplay/CLAUDE.md))
    - (N-2) generic worker threads (for [ChunkGenerateJob](Gameplay/CLAUDE.md))
    - Thread count based on `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`
  - Handles window events and cursor management
  - Coordinates with DevConsole camera system
  - Provides quit request handling

### Game State Management
- **[Game Class](Gameplay/CLAUDE.md)** (`Gameplay/Game.hpp/cpp`): Core game logic controller
  - **States**: `ATTRACT` (menu) and `GAME` (active play)
  - **Update Pipeline**: Input → Entities → [World](Gameplay/CLAUDE.md) updates
  - **Rendering**: Separate attract mode and gameplay rendering paths

## External Interfaces

  - `Default.hlsl` - Basic unlit rendering with Vertex_PCU
  - `BlinnPhong.hlsl` - Phong lighting model
  - `Bloom.hlsl` - Post-processing effects
- **Resource Management**: Vertex/Index buffers, textures, constant buffers

### FMOD Audio System
- **Libraries**: fmod.dll, fmod64.dll
- **Configuration**: Controlled by `ENGINE_DISABLE_AUDIO` preprocessor directive
- **Assets**: Audio files in `Run/Data/Audio/`

## Key Dependencies and Configuration

- **Static Analysis**: SDL security checks enabled
- **Memory Safety**: RAII patterns for all resource management
- **Platform Compliance**: Unicode character set, Windows subsystem

### Error Handling
- **Resource Management**: Exception-safe DirectX resource handling
- **File I/O**: Robust XML parsing with error reporting
- **Memory Allocation**: Proper cleanup of engine and V8 resources

## FAQ

**Q: How does the game coordinate with the separate Engine project?**
A: The Engine project is referenced as a separate Visual Studio project. Game code can include Engine headers but Engine cannot depend on Game code, maintaining clear architectural boundaries.

**Q: What is the role of V8 JavaScript engine?**
A: V8 provides embedded scripting capabilities for game logic. The integration includes automatic DLL deployment and library linking, but specific scripting APIs need further investigation.

**Q: How are DirectX resources managed?**
A: Resources are managed through the Engine's rendering system with RAII patterns. The game provides vertex data and shader specifications, while Engine handles DirectX object lifecycles.

**Q: What triggers chunk mesh rebuilding?**
A: Chunk mesh rebuilding occurs when `m_needsRebuild` flag is set, typically after terrain generation or block modifications. This is an expensive operation that should be batched.
