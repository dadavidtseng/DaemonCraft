## Assignment Comparison

| Assignment | Terminology | Phases/Stages | Status |
|------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **A4: World Generation** | "Phase" | 6 phases (0-5B) | ~98% Complete |
| **A5: Rendering & Lighting** | "Stage" | 8 stages | Not Started |
| **A6: Player & Physics** | "Stage" | 7 stages | Not Started |

**Note:** The professor uses "Phase" for A4 and "Stage" for A5/A6. This terminology is consistent with the original assignment specifications.
